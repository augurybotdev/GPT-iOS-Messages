# gpt-ios-messages


chat with gpt within a mobile friendly web-based iOS messages like interface.

<br>

The neat thing about this concept is that gpt can directly generate user interface elements when asked.

<br>

For example, you can ask for gpt to embed a video and it will directly embed the video, playable directly within the context of the message.
